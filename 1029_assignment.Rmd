## Practice 5.1

Using the rgbif package download data from any species you like. Make a nice map of the distribution of the selected species. Of course you will fix projection problem when plotting you map. You map can be static or interactive. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
